## Improvements from MTG

- **Dynamically sized inventory** - To fit ALL your items.
- **Better bone generation** - Always finds somewhere to place bones, 99% guaranteed.
- **Waypoints** - Bones are marked by a waypoint for some time.
- **New textures** - More detailed and... well, that's about it.
- **Custom sounds** - Because bones are not made of gravel.
